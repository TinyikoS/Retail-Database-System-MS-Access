# Milly’s Chocolate Factory Database System

## Project Description

This group project involved the design and implementation of a fully normalized Microsoft Access database system for Milly’s Chocolate Factory, a chain of chocolate shops that distributes chocolates and sweets to retailers.

The project was completed in two phases:
- **Section 1:** Design of a complete Entity-Relationship (ER) model based on business rules.
- **Section 2:** Implementation of the database in Microsoft Access, including all required objects for end-user functionality.
